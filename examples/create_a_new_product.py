Creating a new product using the Finite State SDK Methods
To create a Product, you will need:

* Business Unit ID (get this from the API or app, see this example)
* Created By User ID (get this from the API)
* Product Name (you make this up)
* Product Description (you make this up)
* Vendor Name (you can get an existing vendor ID, or you can make this up to create a new Vendor)

To install the SDK, use pip:
pip install finite-state-sdk

You can store your secrets in a file called .env in the same directory as this script
that looks like:

export CLIENT_ID="your client id"
export CLIENT_SECRET="your client secret"
export ORGANIZATION_CONTEXT="your organization context"

Before running the script, run the following command in the terminal:
source .env
